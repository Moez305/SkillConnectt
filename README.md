🌟 SkillConnect: Parent-Tutor Matching API !
To showcase my skills and understanding of backend design, I completely rebuilt the SkillConnect API using Java Spring Boot (I Already built this project but it was lost, that's why i recreated it 11-19-2025).

Going beyond basic CRUD, I built connections and interactions between Parents, Tutors, Subjects, Bookings, and Reviews.

Relationship Mapping:

One-to-Many & Many-to-Many, leveraging JPA and real database schemas.
